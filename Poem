The bottom part of a rainbow
Closest to the Earth
Perhaps from there did the grapes and plums drop
A straight fall from the bottom part of a rainbow

The rolling fields of lavender and lilac
I imagine they merely copied
The bottom part of a rainbow
Folding along the ground
Mimicking that color in the sky
